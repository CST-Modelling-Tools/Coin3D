This directory is aimed to decouple project building from packaging since 
maintainer rules are generally independent from the developer ones and 
strongly OS specific.

This source directory will contain CPack configuration templates postfixed 
with '*.cmake.in'.

Usual cmake config invocation will automatically configure every template 
present in this directory producing in the  corresponding binary directory a 
file postfixed with '*.cmake'.

These CPack configurations can be used to finally produce the package with the 
following command:

cpack --config <config name>
